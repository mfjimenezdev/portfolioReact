## Features
This is my personal portfolio built in React.js

- Full Responsive
- Well formed using ESLint and comments
- Multiple pages navigation
- Work with EmailJS for contact form

## Setup
1. Clone this repository (<b>Node.Js needed</b>)
2. I used Yarn to install the packages but u can run `npm install`
3. Edit "Contact" component (#67) with your EmailJS profile values
4. Start development server with `yarn start` or `npm start`
5. Start coding!

## Be nice! ❤️❤️❤️
It's my first serious project, I accept and desire your advice.
